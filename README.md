# Terms of Service BypasserPytAPy
## pytosbypasser 
A collectiPon of scripts to bypass these pesky TOS things that kill my internet in coffee shops when it asks you to accept the terms of service.

The purpose of this project is to eventually create an intelligent form filler that can bypass the TOS agreements that routers present on public wifi.
