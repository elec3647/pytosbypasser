# Python Terms of Service Bypasser
## pytosbypasser
A client to,
  * anonoumyze 
  * anonymze users using free public Wifi access points.
  * bypass those pesky TOS popups that kill your internet connection in coffee shops when it asks you to accept the terms of service.
  * detect services for paid service and autofill or ignore.
  

The purpose of this project is to eventually create an intelligent form filler that can bypass the TOS agreements that routers present on public wifi.

## Project Goals
* Create a client that "learns" how to fill out forms as a human would.
  * Read and analyze form fields and attempt to fill them. 
  * Use anonymized user data to prevent data collection and user tracking.
* Log forms that fail to be bypassed and send information to a central server for further analysis and global learning/updates of all TOS Bypasser clients.
*
